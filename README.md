# Home of Cards Next.js Application

This project is a static Next.js application with Tailwind CSS, built to exactly match the provided design.

## Getting Started

First, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd home_of_cards
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Placeholder Images

This project uses placeholder image files in the `public/` directory (e.g., `logo.png`, `card-placeholder.png`). These should be replaced with actual image assets to perfectly replicate the design.
